## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time using CSS Grid, I'm loving it. Also the hardest challenge up to now. My code looks like spaghetti all tangled up.

### Continued development

I will further improve my understanding and implementation of CSS Grid by going on to the next challenge.
